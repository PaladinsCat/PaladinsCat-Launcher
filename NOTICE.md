## Tempest

Fork source: https://github.com/LowRezStudio/Tempest

Copyright (C) 2025-2026 LowRezStudio contributors.

Tempest is licensed under GNU GPL version 3 or, at your option, any later version. The Rust launch workflow is derived from the contracts in `Tempest.CLI/Launcher/LauncherCommands.cs`, `LauncherUtility.cs` and `Tempest.CLI/Mods/ModCommands.cs` at revision `efe828dd28a48c4e1861ebf25a99cc16bd4b2425`. The full GPL text is in LICENSE.

The native loading contract was also reviewed in `Tempest.CLI/inject/main.zig` at that revision. This repository's independently written Rust loader uses Unicode paths, remote owning-module RVA/image verification and bounded waits in place of the reviewed upstream ANSI path and infinite wait. No upstream C#, Zig injector source or Tempest binaries are copied or redistributed; the standalone launcher does not require a Tempest installation. The upstream copyright and GPL attribution remain retained.

## PaladinsCat

Copyright (C) 2026 PaladinsCat contributors. Localization installer and GUI source were contributed from WatchCat. Native game-hook implementations and recordings are not included. Mod release constants and public package contracts originate in PaladinsCat-mods; its MIT notice is retained in `licenses/PaladinsCat-mods-MIT.txt`. Downloadable native binaries retain their own package license notices.

## Fonts and artwork
